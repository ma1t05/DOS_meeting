\subsection{Stochastic Queue $p$-Median Problem Heuristic}
\begin{frame}
Berman el. al in \cite{berman1987stochastic} proposes easily heuristics procedure 
for locating \textit{p} mobile servie units on a network in the prescene of queueing-like congestion.

It starts with an arbirary initial solution $\bar{X}$.
Given $\bar{X}$ the Hypercuve Model can be employed.
However, instead of applying the Hypercube Model with the parameters $1/\mu^i$ that ignore variations in service time,
a mean service time calibration is performed.
