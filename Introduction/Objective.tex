The aim of this work
is to support decision making
regarding the location and redeployment
of insurance agents to attend car wrecks.

The idea is to
develop models and methods for 
(a) improving the service 
offered by insurance agents, 
helping them
arrive to the accident sites sooner,
and 
(b) determining the number of adjusters
required to perform the service
within the desired standards.
