Components of Path Relinking template \cite{glover1998template} consist of
specific subroutines of the following types:
\begin{itemize}
\item A Diversification Generator: 
  to generate a collection of diverse trial solutions,
  using an arbitrary trial solution (or seed solution) as an input.
\item An Improvement Method:
  to transform a trial solution into one or more enhanced trial solutions. 
  (Neither the input nor output solutions are required to be feasible,
  though the output solutions will more usually be expected to be so.
  If no improvement of the input trial solution results, 
  the ``enhanced'' solution is considered to be the same as the input solution.)
\item A Reference Set Update Method:
  to build and maintain a Reference Set
  consisting of the b best solutions found
  (where the value of b is typically small, e.g., between 20 and 40), 
  organized to provide efficient accessing by other parts of the method.
\item A Subset Generation Method: 
  to operate on the Reference Set, 
  to produce a subset of its solutions 
  as a basis for creating combined solutions.
\item A Solution Combination Method:
  to transform a given subset of solutions 
  produced by the Subset Generation Method
  into one or more combined solution vectors.
\end{itemize}
